### Welcome to My GitHub Account ###

Iâ€™m not using using it for a whole lot these days, to be honest. I have for the most
part moved to a self-hosting my own projects with Mercurial
[here](https://koosah.info/cgi-bin/hgweb.cgi). I'm keeping this GitHub account around
in case I want to start using it more actively again, or in case I want to contribute
to a project that is using GitHub, and so that things I already was storing here
remain here.
